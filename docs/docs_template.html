    <h1>docs_template.html</h1>

    with the content you want to document.

    <h1>Document Naming and Location</h1>
    </p>
    GitHub pages does not support server side scripting.  I would have liked to use PHP or TWIG to make a page template so that each specific document can
    be void of non-topic content as possible. The comprimise is to put all documents in the server root and prepend orginizing informaiton to the from of
    the file.  I have used core_, api_ and docs_ so far.
    </p>

    <h1>menu.html</h1>
    </p>
    The menu.html file containg a bootstrap decorated list that is rendered as the responsive menu that appears on the top of each page.  Edit this file
    to add a link to your newly created documentation.
    </p>

    <h1>bootstrap_head.html</h1>
    </p>
    The bootstrap.html is inclued in the header of each html file to try and keep documentation uncluttered.
