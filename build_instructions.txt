These are just reminders for anyone doing an official chipKIT build what the steps are, they are not meant to be exhaustive step by step instructions.

Must have Ant installed

1) Manually update version.properties file - increment the CHIPKITCOREVER number, save it, then commit
2) Tag the whole repo, with a simple tag of the form "vX.Y.Z" where X Y and Z are the major, minor, and bugfix numbers
3) Push to GH, making sure to push the tag up.
4) Open a command prompt in the repo
5) "ant clean-all"
6) "ant github-release" - this will build the zip file for putting up at GitHub
7) Update the package_chipkit_index.json file
  * Copy/paste the top 'platform' section
  * edit the top one to be the new version
  * change the version number
  * change the url
  * change the archiveFileName
  * change the checksum (copy/paste checksum from .asc file in same directory as .zip file - leave "SHA-256:" in .json file
  * change the size (file will be in \chipkit-core\tmp\ and you can right click and select Properties, then look at "Size" field)
8) Commit and push the updated .json file
9) From chipKIT-core GH page, click Releases tab, click Draft a new release
10) Drag over the new release .zip and .asc files, add text to the new release and publish it (from GH web page)
11) Using the Arduino IDE, test that the new chipKIT-core version is recognized and can be installed by the IDE. If it can't go back to step 7 through 10 and fix whatever is wrong. (Normally just missed characters in the filename or such of the .json file)
12) Edit http://chipkit.net/wiki/index.php?title=ChipKIT_core_release_notes with all of the pull requests that have been merged since the last release
13) Do "ant dist-all" This will build all of the zip file builds for each platform.
14) Upload all of the new .zip files to AWS server
15) Edit http://chipkit.net/wiki/index.php?title=ChipKIT_core to reflect new zip file release build locations
